= Presidential Election Candidates

With the 1932 German Presidential election coming up next month, we need to decide whether to run a candidate of our own or support one from another party. [? if hindenburg_run: Many are calling for us to support the incumbent Hindenburg, despite his <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> tendencies. Contrary to fears, he hasn’t used his office to destroy the republic yet, so supporting him would hopefully prevent the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>, who actually support destroying the republic, from winning. ?][? if not hindenburg_run: With Hindenburg's withdrawal, the German Right is in disarray, struggling to find a candidate who can attract support from the moderate right and middle, while also embodying the unifying character of Hindenburg. It’s likely that the candidate they put forward will have a military or industrial background and will be distanced from the partisan bickering of politics. ?]

On the other hand, many in our party are calling for [+ spd_candidate_1932_disp +] to run again, but he is reluctant. [? if kpd_relation >= 50 : Another strange possibility is an united front with the <span style="color: #700000;">Communists</span>, either to support their candidate or our own candidate. ?][? if sapd_formed: The <span style="color: #9B0000;">**SAPD**</span>, our former leftists, are likely to share an endorsement with the <span style="color: #700000;">Communists</span>. ?]

Anyhow, let's see who will be the candidates on <span class="tooltip-text" title="good game">the campaign trail</span>.

@view_candidates_1


- @reactionary: Who will be the successor to Hindenburg?
- @hindenburg: Hindenburg is, of course, running once more.

@reactionary
view-if: not hindenburg_run

if (dnvp_ideology == "Moderate" && (lvp_formed == 0 or lvp_leader == "Dingeldey")) {

Reviving the Reichsblock that brought Hindenburg to power, the DVP, DNVP, and minor conservative parties are backing war hero and DNVP Reichstag member Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. Like Hindenburg, Lettow-Vorbeck has a somewhat reactionary background, even including participation in the Kapp Putsch, but he staunchly opposes Nazism and has supported his party's moderate leadership against its challengers. Observers expect us to run a candidate against him, and, seeking to negotiate with both sides, the Center and DDP have yet to decide whether to support his candidacy.

var plb_running = 1}

else if ((ddp_ideology == "Moderate" or ddp_ideology == "Left" or lvp_ideology == "Moderate" or lvp_ideology = "Left") && Z_relations > 50 ){

The Weimar Coalition parties have agreed to nominate Hugo Eckener for president! A zeppelin manufacturer and the first man to fly an airship around the world, his political position is in support of free markets, international cooperation, and opposition to the Nazis and reactionaries. While we are heavily expected to support him, we technically do not have to.}

else{

The Bürgerblock has nominated Hans Luther, Reichsbank president, former Chancellor, and the "Politician Without A Party" — a nomination soon seconded by the Center. He's a somewhat uninspiring figure, not very strenuous in his opposition to the Nazis and closely tied with unpopular deflationary politics, but he is at least clearly a democrat.}

@hindenburg
view-if: hindenburg_run
face-image: img/portraits/Hindenburg.jpg

President Hindenburg is, of course, running for re-election, and many in our party are prepared to support him as the last bastion of democracy against Hitler and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>. The <span class="tooltip-text" title="Following Hindenburg's overseeing of Germany's crushing victory at Tannenberg in the Great War, Hindenburg has become the center of a massive personality cult, lauded as the living ideal of German masculinity and patriotism. He is the embodiment of the best virtues of Prussian tradition.">Hindenburg Mythos</span> serves as a powerful rallying point for all parties, as he maintains high personal popularity despite everything Germany has endured. However, the more support he receives from the German left and center, the more Hindenburg views it as a stain on his personal honor. The refusal of August von Mackensen and other high-ranking officers with whom he served during the war to embrace his candidacy proved particularly painful to the Reich president.

In response, he may shift further to the right after the election in an effort to restore his sense of honor and to appease his former comrades and friends on the German Right. This urge has only been reinforced by the Harzburg Front’s refusal to support him without concessions, as they see Hindenburg as the greatest obstacle to their rise to power.

- @harzburg: We await the decision of the Harzburg Front.

@Stahlhelm
if plb_running = 0{
go-to: duesterberg}

The Harzburg Front has fractured, with the Stahlhelm backing Lettow-Vorbeck, due to large grassroots enthusiasm for the man and his own membership in the organization. This has provoked the ire of the DNF, which, lacking the resources to run its own candidate separate from the Stahlhelm, has simply failed to make an endorsement.

@duesterberg
face-image: img/portraits/duesterberg.jpg

if (dnvp_ideology == "Moderate"){

The Harzburg Front has fractured, with the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNF**</span> and <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> nominating a separate candidate than the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, who rather run their own candidate. The DNVP will be supporting the Bürgerblock candidate. In a deal between the leadership of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> and Hugenberg, the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNF**</span> is to support and campaign for whoever the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> nominates, in exchange for the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span>'s full support for the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNF**</span> in the upcoming local elections. The <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> have decided to nominate its deputy leader, Theodor Duesterberg. }

- @hitler: Who will the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> run?

@hitler
face-image: img/portraits/hitler2.jpg

The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> will run Adolf Hitler, who is likely to only receive the backing of his own party. However, there has been some reluctance on Hitler's part to run against President Hindenburg, with his character commanding great respect throughout all corners of Germany. Furthermore, the second most important leader in the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, Gregor Strasser, opposes his candidacy as he believes he cannot defeat Hindenburg, but <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> propagandist Joseph Goebbels argues for it. We suspect that the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> are putting on a show of indecisiveness, and always had Hitler as as candidate in mind.

- @communist: We await the decision the <span style="color: #700000;">Communists</span>.

@communist
if (concilators == 0) {
go-to: thalmann}
else {go-to: muzenburg}

@thalmann
face-image: img/portraits/ThälmannErnst.jpg

The <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span> will run Ernst Thälmann, their leader and candidate in 1925. If we were to not run a candidate, or to support a right-wing or bourgeois one, Thälmann and the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> would greatly capitalize by painting themselves as the only left-wing option in the race. However, if our relations with the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> are high enough, we may be able to convince him to drop out in favour of a unity candidate between our two parties.

@muzenburg

The <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>, following Thälmann's removal from his leadership position, will run Willi Müzenberg, an anti-Stalinist filmmaker and writer. If we were to not run a candidate, or to support a right-wing or bourgeois one, Thälmann and the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> would greatly capitalize by painting themselves as the only left-wing option in the race — Müzenberg's propaganda skills and ideological flexibility would greatly aid this. However, if our relations with the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> are high enough, we may be able to convince him to drop out in favour of a unity candidate between our two parties, though most expect him to be said unity candidate.

- @socialist: So, what is our decision? Should we run our own candidate?

@socialist
go-to: braun


@braun
face-image: img/portraits/braun.jpg

if (plb_running == 1) {

Otto Braun has been floated around as a candidate for the presidency once more, after his failed run in 1925. He is personally reluctant, and it would take a lot of convincing to get him to run, but after that, could he even win? It's unlikely for bourgeois parties to outright support a <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span> for President, even with his reformist and right-wing leanings within our own party. Still, he is heavily expected to run, and supporting von Lettow-Vorbeck would be extremely controversial.
